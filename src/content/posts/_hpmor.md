*Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality* (HPMOR for short) is a fanfic written by Eliezer Yudkowsky, AI researcher and founder of [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/).
The book follows the story of Harry Potter, except Harry is now a rationalist who grew up with a very strong scientific background.

This book had me hooked immediately. My favorite book genres, by far, are nonfiction and fantasy.
