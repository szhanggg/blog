Hey welcome to my daily blog!
The goal is to post a couple interesting thoughts and life updates every day.

Five minutes ago I was listening to Chinese Pop music, sitting in a Rehoboth Beach Airbnb, when I suddenly realized I hardly understood most of the words in the songs.
I'm what the language learning community would call a *heritage speaker*, meaning I picked Chinese up through talking with my parents at home.
I want to be able to pass on Chinese to my kids and indulge in large parts of Chinese culture including music or shows.
None of these wants can be fulfilled with my current level of knowledge, which is why I'm going to embark on a journey of forced immersion.

I've already changed my phone's default language to Chinese, and I'm also going to only watch subbed Chinese dramas.
I'll report back my progress in a few weeks!
